# Retail-order-data-analysis
In this project, the objective is to evaluate and enhance sales performance by uncovering critical patterns, high-performing products, and potential areas for expansion using a dataset of sales transactions. The aim is to extract valuable insights that can support strategic decisions and foster business growth.

Tech Stack and Tools Applied:
Kaggle API: For getting retail order dataset directly from Kaggle.
Python: Utilized for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis.
SQL: Used for storing and querying the cleaned dataset.
Streamlit: For building a real-time, interactive dashboard to display insights.

Identify Top-Performing Products: Analyze the products and categories that contribute the most to revenue and profit.
Sales Trend Analysis: Perform Year-over-Year (YoY) and Month-over-Month (MoM) comparisons to identify sales trends.
Profit Margin Analysis: Highlight the subcategories with the highest profit margins to guide future sales strategies.
Regional Analysis: Explore sales data by region to identify high-performing areas.
Discount Impact: Analyze the effects of discounts on product sales, especially those with more than 20 percentage off.

Project Flow
Data Extraction: Fetch raw data from Kaggle API.
Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset to handle missing values, standardize column names, and derive new columns (e.g., discount, sale price).
SQL Integration: Load cleaned data into a SQL database for efficient querying.
SQL Queries: Run advanced queries to generate business insights and trends.
Streamlit Dashboard: Build an interactive dashboard to display the results dynamically.
This project aims to provide meaningful insights into the retail order data, helping businesses make informed decisions about their products, sales strategies, and market opportunities. By combining data extraction, cleaning, SQL analysis, and Streamlit visualization, we offer a comprehensive approach to analyzing retail sales performance.

This project integrates multiple components:

Data Extraction: Using Kaggle API to fetch raw sales data.
Data Cleaning: Applying transformations to standardize and prepare the data for analysis.
SQL Database Integration: Moving the cleaned data into SQL for efficient querying and analysis.
Business Insights: Extracting valuable insights using SQL queries to answer key business questions.
Interactive Dashboard: Building a real-time dashboard in Streamlit to visualize the findings.
